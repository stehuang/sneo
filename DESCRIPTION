Description: A sequential nonlinear orientation of edges (SNOE) procedure for learning nonlinear, gaussian data generated from Causal Additive Noise Models. This algorithm consists of four stages: learning the initial CPDAG, determining the orientation of undirected edges, removing superfluous edges, and converting a PDAG to a DAG.
